# mazeSolver
Implementation of paper coding challenge

You have to build the maze in JSON first, but in theory, you could make one any size & it'd work.

Where there is a decision about which direction to make, it'll randomly choose one of the options then persue it until it hits a dead end, at which point it'll go back to the last choice, so truly random & it won't take the same route through every time to find the resolution.

Once a full path through has been found, it'll highlight the route.
